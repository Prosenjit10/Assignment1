	<h1>Importance of Writting</h1>
	<p>Knowing how to write is a really important thing in life. We need it every day for communication, school, studies, administrative tasks, and a lot of other things. <br>But we also can use it for arts, and to express ourselves : that is what I will be talking about here. I will be more especially talking about writing books, texts, songs, poetry since it’s what I like.</p>

	<h2>My Experience</h2>
	<p>I’ve always been writing in my life: first, it was in my little pink diaries, then at school when we had to use our imagination to do written expressions, but most of the time now I use expressive writing to describe my feelings and troubles of everyday life. Writing poetry, texts, songs and sharing them with other people can also help everybody feel less alone, and making pain something beautiful or useful is a really positive action in my opinion</p>
	<h3><u>Main reason and result</u></h3>
	<p><b> As well as being interesting for my studies, it's also interesting for my English level since I could find English scientific articles about that subject. It's very fulfilling to read those articles that name pathologies and disorders that I didn't know in English.</b></p>
